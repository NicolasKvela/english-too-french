# english-to-french
Around July 15, 2025, we made a simple English to French translator using Python. The goal was to teach a small AI how to turn English sentences into French. We used a list of English and French sentence pairs to help the AI learn. First, we changed the words into numbers so the AI could read them. Then we made sure all the sentences were the same length. We built a model that could take an English sentence and try to make the matching French sentence. After training, it could translate on its own.
When errors came up, like problems running the code or missing parts, I asked ChatGPT for help. ChatGPT helped fix the code, find mistakes, and explain what each part was doing. It made it easier to build and run the translator without getting stuck. Since this was the first project we did I got stuck pretty often, but with the help of my professor and peirs I understood how to understnad what the eroor is and how to fix it. 
I also learned how to make and use a virtual environment, install packages, and run Python scripts the right way.
